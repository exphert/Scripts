### Open devtools in you discord app, with CTRL + SHIFT + i (if not work, follow this step below)
```
1. Navigate to the Discord settings folder:
  - Windows: Open the Run dialog (Win+R), type %APPDATA%\Discord\, and press Enter.
  - macOS: Navigate to ~/Library/Application Support/discord/.
  - Linux: Navigate to ~/.config/discord/ or ~/.discord/.
2. Open the settings.json file in a text editor like Notepad++ or TextEdit.
3. Locate the closing } brace at the end of the file. Before this brace, add the following line, ensuring it is properly formatted with a comma if needed:
"DANGEROUS_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS_ONLY_ENABLE_IF_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOURE_DOING": true
4. Save the file and restart Discord. The DevTools shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I) should now work.
```

### Then copy the content of the script you want to use and paste in discord app console (if cannot paste, type `allow pasting`, then paste again)

## IMPORTANT!!
Follow the printed instructions depending on what type of quest you have
- If your quest says to "play" the game or watch a video, you can just wait and do nothing
- If your quest says to "stream" the game, join a vc with a friend or alt and stream any window
